# miguelguthridge.com

My old personal website, which I'm keeping around because that's what I can
send to transphobes to avoid outing myself.

For my new site, see [maddyguthridge.com](https://maddyguthridge.com). It's a
better website anyway :3

Content is in `docs/` because I can't be bothered to set up a GitHub actions
workflow to deploy from something like `src/` (even though that'd make more
sense).
